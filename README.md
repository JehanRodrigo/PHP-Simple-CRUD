Hi, Welcome !

Here is a Simple CRUD Operation I designed in PHP for Learning purposes.
Feel Free to clone and use it as long as you learn something.

Instructions: 
1: Create a table named "userdetails" and database "crudoperation" using "http://localhost/phpmyadmin/"
2: Create Columns of ID, name, email, phone, address and make sure to tick auto increment for the ID column.
3: Clone the repo to your local computer.
4: Copy the "PHP-Simple-CRUD" folder into the "htdocs" folder inside your XAMPP folder.
5: Go to your browser and go "localhost/PHP-Simple-CRUD/display.php"
6: Use functions adduser, Update, Delete and Enjoy !!
